# Gaussian Process

Intuitively, Gaussian distribution define the **state space**, while Gaussian Process define the **function space**

For a RV(random variable) **X** that follow Gaussian Distribution **N(0, 1)** should be following image:

The P.D.F should be

As for Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
