# Distributional RL

Make reward like Dopamine

---

## A Distributional Perspective on Reinforcement Learning

Everything begins here. It propose C51.

## A distributional code for value in dopaminebased reinforcement learning

[Blog](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Dopamine-and-temporal-difference-learning-A-fruitful-relationship-between-neuroscience-and-AI)

Reveal the relation bewteen distributional RL and dopamine.

## Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Quantile Regression

It propose QR-DQN.

## Implicit Quantile Networks for Distributional Reinforcement Learning

It propose IQN.

## Distributional Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Exploration

Distributional RL improve the exploration strategy.

## DSAC: Distributional Soft Actor Critic for Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning

The paper propose DSAC which use a distribution to estimate the Q function with SAC.

## Cautious Reinforcement Learning via Distributional Risk in the Dual Domain

Risk-sensitive RL.
